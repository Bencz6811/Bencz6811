Hello, my name is Bence DÃ³czi. And I want to introduce myself with a few words.

I am 18 years old, from Hungary. I am a secondary school student, learning IT managment and programming. My favourite programming language is C# and this I am interested in that too. But I tried Python, C++, Javascript and most of them.

I am interested in software development jobs. The IT world is what my family in, my Dad is repairing laptops, computers, and my big brother is a software developer. I would like to work as a software developer in the future.

Thank you, for reading my introduction! :)

Have a greatday/afternoon/night!
